- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben
- 👀 I’m interested in sci-fi, fantasy, arts & crafts, social dancing, graphic design and of course programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a Java developer, but I already did some programming in the past. I used to make android apps in  C# and a a bit in Java & kotlin too. 
- I dabbled a bit in JavaScript (mainly in the Goolgle Apps Script API), and some other languages like LaTex, objective-C, ruby & python, but not enough to claim any skills.
- I'm quite proficient in Photoshop and I'm familiar with Illustrator, inDesign and a little with GIMP.
- I prefer the Google suite over MS office, so obviously my skills in the former exceed those in the latter.
- 💞️ I’m looking to expand my skills and get some experience, hopefully the coronapocalypse doesn't prevent me from getting an internship this summer
